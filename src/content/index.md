Lauren Cerand is the founder and owner of Lauren Cerand Public Relations, and has been active in the field since 2001. In 2025, Morgan Jerkins said, when [profiled](https://paw.princeton.edu/article/morgan-jerkins-14-explores-love-across-generations-new-novel) in _Princeton Alumni Weekly_, “I knew it would take a village—in-house with HarperCollins and with outside publicist Lauren Cerand—for _Zeal_ to succeed.”

**Cerand is available for select strategic consulting in 2026, and for full book campaigns requested by new clients, she is currently reading for 2027 publication dates.**

In 2026, Cerand will speak to audiences in-person at Dartmouth and the Chesapeake Writers’ Conference, and, in January, she will launch two new literary event series in Brooklyn, at [Anaïs](https://www.anaisbk.com/) and the [Urbane Arts Club](https://www.urbanebrooklyn.com/).

Her publicity list in 2026 includes:

**Winter:** [_Generator_](https://schaffnerpress.com/books/generator/) by Rinny Gremaud, a debut novel, translated from the French by Holly James, that _Shelf Awareness_says, “provides a deeply meditative examination of identity––’relative, if not fluid’––provocatively conflating nuclear power with biological ancestry,” _Foreword Reviews_ called “an enthralling, genre-bending novella,” and _Publishers Weekly_ says, “leaves readers with much to chew on” (Schaffner Press, January); [_Hostages: A Counter-History of Colonial Plunder_](https://schaffnerpress.com/books/hostages/) by Taina Tervonen, new narrative nonfiction from a winner of the Jan Michalski Prize for Literature, translated from the French by Sara Hanaburgh (Schaffner Press, February).

**Spring:** [_The Daughters_](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Daughters/Joanna-Margaret/9781613166772) by Joanna Margaret (Mysterious Press, March); [Deborah Brown English’s](https://www.deborahbrownenglish.com/) _Time’s Breath_ art exhibition, opening at Creative Alliance in Baltimore in early March, after rave reviews for the accompanying book in September, including by Jack Livingston in [_Bmore Art:_](https://bmoreart.com/2025/09/book-review-times-breath-by-deborah-brown-english.html) “It transported me back to that golden age of publishing. As I sat down with the book and flipped through its pages, I discovered something more intricate—a modern reinterpretation of this genre. It’s both a deconstruction and a reconstruction of the classic illustrated fantasy fiction books of the past.”

**Summer:** Two newly reissued novels by Howard Rodman in May; [_Brahms Comes to Dinner_](http://shop.btpubservices.com/Title/9781639640836) by Boman Desai (Schaffner Press, June).

**Fall:** _Any Kind of Known Tomorrow_ by [Leah De Forest](https://leahdeforest.net/) (a debut novel; Betty Books, September), and _Dope Calisthenics_ by Sylvia Jones ([Relegation Books](https://www.relegationbooks.com/), Fall 2026).

In 2027, confirmed authors include [Kirmen Uribe](https://kirmenuribe.eus/en/).

She holds a Bachelor’s of Science degree in [Industrial & Labor Relations](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/) from Cornell University. She serves on the advisory committee of [Film Forum](https://filmforum.org/) in New York, and lives in Baltimore.
