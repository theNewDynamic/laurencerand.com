Lauren Cerand (b. 1979 in Washington, D.C.) is a publicist and consultant with more than two decades of experience in the worlds of literature and the arts, spanning strategic communications to high-profile events and board leadership.

So far in 2025, she has spoken in-person to audiences at the [Dallas Literary Festival](https://www.dallasliteraryfestival.org/), the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the Chesapeake Writers’ Conference (she is confirmed to return to the latter for a third year running in 2026). She serves on the advisory committee of [Film Forum](https://filmforum.org/) in New York.

Her publicity list in 2025 includes Prix Renaudot winner Tierno Monénembo, for his new novel, _The Lives and Deaths of Véronique Bangoura_, translated from the French by Ryan Chamberlain for [Schaffner Press](https://schaffnerpress.com/) (March); _New York Times_ bestselling author [Morgan Jerkins](http://www.morgan-jerkins.com/), for her new novel, _Zeal_ (Harper, April); literary critic [Martha Anne Toll](https://www.marthaannetoll.com/), for her new novel, _Duet for One_ (Regal House, May); artist and debut novelist [Deborah Brown English](https://www.deborahbrownenglish.com/) for _Time’s Breath_(September); artist and debut novelist [Margaret Hutton](https://www.margarethutton.com/) for _If You Leave_ (Regal House, October); and Will Mountain Cox, editor of _The Relegation Reader_, a new anthology of contemporary writing from Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. ([Relegation Books](https://www.relegationbooks.com/), November).

In July, Morgan Jerkins said, when [profiled](https://paw.princeton.edu/article/morgan-jerkins-14-explores-love-across-generations-new-novel) in _Princeton Alumni Weekly_, “I knew it would take a village— in-house with HarperCollins and with outside publicist Lauren Cerand— for _Zeal_ to succeed.”

Cerand’s confirmed 2026 projects comprise a fiction-forward list, leading with titles such as _Generator_ by Rinny Gremaud (a debut novel, translated from the French by Holly James; Schaffner Press, January), _Hostages: A Counter-History of Colonial Plunder_ by Taina Tervonen (new narrative nonfiction from a Jan Michalski Prizewinner, translated from the French by Sara Hanaburgh; Schaffner Press, February), _The Daughters_ by Joanna Margaret (Mysterious Press, March), _Any Kind of Known Tomorrow_ by Leah De Forest (a debut novel; Betty Books, September), and _Dope Calisthenics_ by Sylvia Jones (Relegation Books, Fall 2026).

Cerand holds a Bachelor’s of Science degree in [Industrial & Labor Relations](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/) from Cornell University and a Certificate in Jewelry Marketing & Design from [Pratt Institute](https://www.pratt.edu/), and attended [Alchimia Contemporary Jewelry School in Firenze](https://alchimia.it/) full-time in 2019-2020 while living in Italy. She lives in Baltimore.
