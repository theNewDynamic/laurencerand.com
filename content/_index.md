“Publicist does not do this connector-extraordinaire justice: think, rather, of a Wharton hostess armed with an iPhone, draped in vintage and with even an array of hats (with pins) in the back of her Mini.” — Patrick Gale

Lauren Cerand has more than twenty years of experience running her own global communications consultancy, driven by an intensive personal focus on each client’s needs and desires, a vast network of relationships, and unparalleled expertise and creative ingenuity.

She recently discussed her signature perspective on the "[How to Think Like a Publicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EfxR81xdpQ)" Craftwork episode of Otherppl podcast, hosted by **Brad Listi**.

In 2024, Lauren will continue long-term consulting relationships with **Relegation Books**, which recently launched [R&R](https://www.relegationbooks.com/journal/), a literary magazine edited by **Joseph Grantham**; will bring **Will Mountain Cox** on U.S. tour in February for *Roundabout*; and will publish *The Trees* by **Claudia Peña Claros**, translated from Spanish by **Robin Myers**, in August; and **House of Anansi Press**, which Lauren advises on U.S. audience development.

Her publicity list focused on individual titles (–– join us for a year in reading!) includes, for the first half of 2024, *The Gardins of Edin* by **Rosey Lee** (January), *The Exhausted of the Earth: Politics in a Burning World* (February) by **Ajay Singh Chaudhary**, and *Hiding For My Life: Being Gay in the Navy* by **Karen Solt**, already [featured](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/09/25/navy-dont-ask-dont-tell-military-records-pentagon-veterans-liebermann-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn) on CNN (June).

She serves as an advisor to Film Forum and *Off Assignment*.

Lauren has a bachelor’s degree from Cornell University in Industrial & Labor Relations and a certificate from Pratt Institute in Jewelry Marketing & Design, and attended Alchimia Contemporary Jewellery School in Firenze full-time in 2019-2020. After two decades in New York and a year in Italy, Lauren now lives in Baltimore, a move that was named a [literary highlight](https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/top-literary-news-of-2023-charm-city-edition/) of the year.
